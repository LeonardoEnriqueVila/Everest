# To-Do List with Gamification

This repository contains a To-Do List application created with Python. The project uses `tkinter` for the graphical user interface, `datetime` for date and time management, and `sqlite` for database storage. The initial intention was to gamify the task list by assigning points to each task with a scoring system. However, the project was never fully completed due to time constraints.

## Description

The To-Do List application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as assign points to each task. The idea was to create a system where users could accumulate points by completing tasks, making the process of task management more engaging and fun. Despite the project's incomplete status, it still serves as a significant part of my learning journey in Python programming.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Points System**: Assign points to tasks (initial idea).
- **Database Storage**: Tasks and points are stored in an SQLite database.
- **Date and Time**: Uses `datetime` to manage task deadlines.

## Modules Used

- **tkinter**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **datetime**: Used for managing date and time-related functionality.
- **sqlite**: Used for storing task data in a database.

## Notes

- This project is incomplete and was primarily a learning exercise. The gamification feature was not fully implemented.
- The project contains a substantial amount of code, reflecting my efforts and progress in Python programming.

## Portfolio

While this project remains incomplete, it is included in my portfolio to showcase my ongoing learning process and the complexity of the ideas I explore. For more polished and complete projects, please visit my other projects.
